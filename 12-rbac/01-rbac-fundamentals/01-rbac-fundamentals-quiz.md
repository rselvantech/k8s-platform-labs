# Quiz — 12-rbac/01-rbac-fundamentals: RBAC and the Kubernetes Authorization Model

> One correct answer per question unless stated otherwise.
> Target: 80% or above before moving to next demo.

**Q1. You apply a RoleBinding whose `roleRef.name` has a typo pointing to a Role that doesn't exist. What happens?**

- A) The `apply` command fails immediately with a `NotFound` error
- B) The `apply` command succeeds, and the binding silently grants no permissions
- C) Kubernetes auto-corrects the typo using fuzzy matching against existing Role names
- D) The RoleBinding is created in a `Pending` state until a matching Role appears

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B** — RoleBinding creation does not validate that `roleRef` points at an existing Role. The apply succeeds cleanly; the only symptom is that `kubectl auth can-i` checks for that subject return `no`, identical to no binding existing at all.
Trap: A is wrong because this only happens when the RoleBinding's namespace doesn't contain a same-named Role at all (a different failure mode). C and D describe behaviors Kubernetes RBAC does not have — there is no fuzzy matching or pending state for RBAC objects.

**Q2. A Role named `pod-log-reader` exists in namespace `ci`. You create a RoleBinding referencing it, but the RoleBinding's `metadata.namespace` is set to `default`. What happens?**

- A) The RoleBinding is created successfully and grants access in `default`
- B) The RoleBinding is created but silently grants nothing, exactly like a typo'd `roleRef.name`
- C) `kubectl apply` fails immediately with a `NotFound` error, because `roleRef` lookups are scoped to the RoleBinding's own namespace
- D) Kubernetes automatically moves the RoleBinding to the `ci` namespace to match the Role

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**C** — Unlike a typo'd Role name (which applies silently, per Q1), a cross-namespace reference is caught immediately at apply time, because the lookup for `roleRef` only searches the RoleBinding's own namespace — a same-named Role elsewhere is invisible to it.
Trap: B is the tempting answer because it feels consistent with Q1's "silent failure" pattern, but the two failure modes are genuinely different — same-namespace-wrong-name fails silently; wrong-namespace-correct-name fails loudly. D is not real Kubernetes behavior.

</details>

---

**Q3. A Role's only rule is `apiGroups: [""], resources: ["pods"], verbs: ["get"]`. A subject bound to this Role runs `kubectl get pods` (no Pod name). What happens?**

- A) It succeeds — `get` covers listing since you're "getting" the pods
- B) It fails — `list` is a separate verb from `get` and was never granted
- C) It succeeds only for the first Pod alphabetically
- D) It fails because `pods` must be written as `pod` (singular) for list operations

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B** — `kubectl get pods` with no specific name performs a `list` API call, which is a distinct verb from `get`. A rule granting only `get` lets you fetch one specifically-named Pod but does not cover listing.
Trap: A is the most common real-world mistake — assuming `get` is a superset of list access. D inverts the actual rule (resource names must be plural, not singular).

</details>

---

**Q4. You need to grant a subject read access to Pod logs. Your Role's rule is `apiGroups: [""], resources: ["pods"], verbs: ["get","list","watch"]`. Log access still fails. Why?**

- A) `pods/log` is a separate resource that must be explicitly listed
- B) Log access requires the `read` verb, which is missing
- C) Pod logs are only accessible via ClusterRole, never Role
- D) The rule needs `apiGroups: ["logs"]` instead of `""`

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**A** — Pod logs are exposed as the `pods/log` subresource, which is a distinct entry from `pods` in the `resources` array. Granting `pods` alone does not include its subresources.
Trap: B invents a verb that doesn't exist in Kubernetes RBAC. D confuses subresource naming with apiGroup naming — logs are still in the core group (`""`), just a different resource string.

</details>

---

**Q5. Why does Kubernetes RBAC have no "deny" rule type?**

- A) Deny rules were removed in a past Kubernetes version for performance reasons
- B) RBAC is designed as strictly additive — effective permissions are the union of every applicable grant, with no mechanism to subtract from it
- C) Deny rules exist but require a separate `DenyPolicy` object not covered in this demo
- D) Namespaces implicitly deny everything not explicitly granted, making deny rules redundant

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B** — RBAC's model is purely additive by design. You cannot write a rule that revokes a permission granted by another binding — the only way to reduce access is to remove or narrow the grant itself.
Trap: C describes something that does not exist in core Kubernetes RBAC (that's closer to what NetworkPolicy or OPA/Gatekeeper provide for other concerns, not RBAC). D conflates "no binding exists" (implicit no) with an active deny rule, which is a different concept.

</details>

---

**Q6. You run `kubectl auth can-i delete pods -n ci --as=alice` and get `yes`. What does this guarantee?**

- A) Alice's actual `kubectl delete pod` command will always succeed
- B) Only that the Authorization (RBAC) stage would allow the request — Admission Control could still reject it
- C) Alice has cluster-admin access
- D) The Pod alice wants to delete does not have a finalizer blocking deletion

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B** — `can-i` only evaluates the AuthZ stage. A `yes` confirms RBAC permits the attempt, but Admission Control (quotas, validating webhooks, Pod Security Admission) evaluates independently afterward and can still reject the same request.
Trap: A is the common misconception this question targets directly. D introduces a real but unrelated Kubernetes concept (finalizers) that `can-i` has no visibility into either way.

</details>

---

**Q7. A Role's rule uses `apiGroups: ["core"]` for a Pods rule. What's the effect?**

- A) It works identically to `apiGroups: [""]` — "core" is just a human-readable alias
- B) It silently matches nothing, because the actual core group identifier is the empty string, not the literal word "core"
- C) It throws a validation error at apply time
- D) It grants access to all API groups, treating "core" as a wildcard

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B** — The core API group's real identifier is `""` (empty string). `"core"` is a common informal/spoken label for it, not a value Kubernetes recognizes. RBAC does not validate `apiGroups` values against real groups, so the rule applies cleanly but matches zero real resources.
Trap: A is the exact misconception the informal name creates. D confuses this with an actual wildcard, which would be written as `apiGroups: ["*"]`.

</details>

---

**Q8. You need to edit an existing RoleBinding so it references a different Role. What must you do?**

- A) `kubectl edit rolebinding` and change the `roleRef.name` field directly
- B) `kubectl patch` the `roleRef` field with a JSON merge patch
- C) Delete the RoleBinding and create a new one with the desired `roleRef`
- D) Use `kubectl replace --force`, which is the only command allowed to touch `roleRef`

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**C** — `roleRef` is immutable after creation, by design — this forces a delete-and-recreate, which produces an explicit audit trail instead of a silent in-place change that could invisibly re-grant different permissions to existing subjects.
Trap: A and B both describe edit-style operations that the API server will reject specifically because `roleRef` is immutable. D describes real `kubectl replace --force` behavior inaccurately — it isn't a documented special case for RBAC immutability.

</details>

---

**Q9. When would granting access via a `ClusterRole` + `ClusterRoleBinding` be the correct choice instead of `Role` + `RoleBinding`?**

- A) Whenever the Role's rule list has more than 3 entries
- B) Whenever the access is genuinely cluster-scoped (e.g. Nodes) or intentionally needs to span every namespace
- C) Never — Role + RoleBinding should always be preferred for any use case
- D) Whenever the subject is a ServiceAccount rather than a User

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B** — ClusterRole + ClusterRoleBinding is correct when the resource itself is cluster-scoped (Nodes, PersistentVolumes) or when the intent is genuinely cluster-wide access. Using it purely out of convenience for a namespace-local need over-provisions and widens blast radius unnecessarily.
Trap: A introduces an irrelevant heuristic (rule count has nothing to do with scope choice). D is a distractor — ServiceAccounts can be bound via either Role+RoleBinding or ClusterRole+ClusterRoleBinding depending on the actual scope needed, not automatically the latter.

</details>

---

**Q10. What is the key structural difference between a `User` subject and a `ServiceAccount` subject in RBAC?**

- A) There is no difference — both are backed by the same underlying API object
- B) `ServiceAccount` is a real, first-class API object with its own lifecycle; `User` is just a string supplied by the authenticator with no backing object
- C) `User` subjects can only be bound via ClusterRoleBinding, never RoleBinding
- D) `ServiceAccount` subjects cannot be used with impersonation (`--as`)

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B** — A `ServiceAccount` is a genuine Kubernetes API object (`kubectl get serviceaccounts` works) with its own namespace and token lifecycle. A `User` has no corresponding object at all — it's a plain string that Kubernetes trusts the authentication layer to have already verified.
Trap: C is false — Users can be bound via RoleBinding, as this entire demo demonstrates. D is also false — ServiceAccounts can be impersonated with `--as=system:serviceaccount:<ns>:<name>`, just as Users can.

</details>

---

**Q11. A Role uses `resources: ["*"]`, intending to grant only two specific resources. `kubectl auth can-i` checks for those two resources both return `yes`, exactly as expected. Is this Role correctly scoped?**

- A) Yes — the checks that matter both pass
- B) No — `resources: ["*"]` grants every resource in the rule's `apiGroups`, and the two passing checks are just a subset of a much larger over-grant that spot-checking will never reveal
- C) Yes, as long as `verbs` is not also set to `["*"]`
- D) No — wildcards are rejected by the API server at apply time

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B** — A wildcard in `resources` matches everything in the listed `apiGroups`, not just the resources the author had in mind. Because the intended resources are a subset of what actually got granted, every check aimed at them returns the "correct" answer — the over-grant is invisible unless you audit with `can-i --list` or read the YAML directly.
Trap: A treats passing spot-checks as sufficient verification, which is exactly the trap. C wrongly assumes only one wildcard field matters. D is false — wildcards are valid RBAC syntax and apply without error.

</details>

---

**Q12. `kubectl auth can-i --list` shows a row with an empty `Resources` column and `/healthz` under `Non-Resource URLs`. Which object type can express a rule matching this?**

- A) A `Role` in any namespace
- B) A `ClusterRole` only
- C) Both `Role` and `ClusterRole` equally
- D) A `TriggerAuthentication`

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B** — `nonResourceURLs` rules match API server endpoints with no backing Kubernetes object and therefore no namespace to scope to — they can only be expressed in a cluster-scoped `ClusterRole`, never a namespaced `Role`.
Trap: A and C both wrongly assume `Role` can express this. D confuses this with an unrelated KEDA concept from a different demo.

</details>

---

**Q13. Is there a `kubectl list pods` command?**

- A) Yes, it's equivalent to `kubectl get pods`
- B) No — `list` is an API-level verb only; `kubectl get` (with no object name) is the CLI command that issues it
- C) Yes, but only for cluster-scoped resources
- D) No — Kubernetes has no `list` verb at all, only `get`

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B** — `kubectl get` is the single CLI entry point covering both the `get` and `list` API verbs — passing a name issues `get`, omitting one issues `list`. There's no separate `kubectl list` subcommand.
Trap: A implies a command that doesn't exist. C invents a scope restriction that isn't real. D is wrong — `list` is a real, distinct API verb, just not a distinct CLI command.

</details>

---

**Q14. Can one `RoleBinding` grant a Role to multiple subjects at once?**

- A) No — each RoleBinding may reference exactly one subject
- B) Yes — `subjects` is a list; one RoleBinding can bind the same Role to several Users, Groups, and ServiceAccounts simultaneously
- C) Only if all subjects are the same `kind`
- D) Only for ClusterRoleBindings, not RoleBindings

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B** — `subjects` is a list field. A single RoleBinding can include multiple Users, Groups, and ServiceAccounts together, all receiving the identical grant from the one referenced Role.
Trap: A understates what the field actually supports. C invents a same-kind restriction that doesn't exist — a RoleBinding can mix subject kinds freely. D wrongly restricts this to ClusterRoleBindings; RoleBindings support the same list structure.

</details>

---

**Q15. A manifest creating a Deployment declares `apiVersion: apps/v1`. What does the corresponding PolicyRule's `apiGroups` field contain?**

- A) `["apps/v1"]` — the full apiVersion string
- B) `["apps"]` — the group portion only, never the version
- C) `["v1"]` — the version portion only
- D) `["apps.v1"]`

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B** — `apiGroups` in a PolicyRule names only the group, never the version. RBAC grants apply across every version of a resource within that group, which is exactly why the version has no equivalent field in a PolicyRule.
Trap: A and D both smuggle the version into the group field, which the API server would reject or silently fail to match. C drops the group entirely, losing the actual identifying information.

</details>

---

**Q16. The API server runs with `--authorization-mode=Node,RBAC`. A request is denied by the Node authorizer but allowed by RBAC. What's the outcome?**

- A) Denied — the first authorizer in the list wins
- B) Allowed — any single authorizer returning allow is sufficient to admit the request
- C) The request is queued for manual review
- D) Denied — authorizers must unanimously agree to allow

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B** — Every configured authorizer is consulted; the request is admitted the moment any one of them says allow. Order affects which authorizer is checked first for efficiency, not the final outcome.
Trap: A and D both assume a stricter model (first-wins or unanimous-required) that isn't how `--authorization-mode` actually composes multiple authorizers. C describes behavior that doesn't exist in Kubernetes authorization.

</details>

---

**Q17. A Role grants `create` on `pods` with no other constraints. Can the bound subject create 10,000 Pods in that namespace?**

- A) No — RBAC caps object creation at a reasonable default
- B) Yes — RBAC has no concept of quantity limits; that requires ResourceQuota/LimitRange separately
- C) No, not without also granting `deletecollection`
- D) Only if `resourceNames` lists 10,000 names

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B** — RBAC governs whether an action is allowed at all, never how many times. Capping the count is ResourceQuota/LimitRange's job, a completely separate Admission Control mechanism.
Trap: A invents a default RBAC doesn't have. D confuses `resourceNames` (restricting to existing named objects) with a quantity limit on new creates, which `resourceNames` can't express anyway (see Q4 on `resourceNames` + `create`).

</details>

---

**Q18. Your organization needs an authorization decision that checks a live external HR/IAM system in real time for group membership. Which authorizer type is actually designed for this?**

- A) RBAC, using a `ClusterRole` that references the external system
- B) ABAC, using its static policy file
- C) Webhook, since it delegates the decision to an external HTTP(S) service per request
- D) Node authorizer, since it's the only one that supports external calls

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**C** — Webhook is specifically designed to delegate authorization decisions to an external service via a `SubjectAccessReview` HTTP(S) round-trip per request. RBAC and ABAC both evaluate entirely from local, static configuration; Node authorizer is a fixed, narrow, kubelet-only rule with no external-call capability at all.
Trap: A invents a capability RBAC doesn't have — Roles reference Kubernetes resources, not external systems. D misattributes network-calling ability to the one authorizer that's explicitly local-only.

</details>

---

**Q19. You run `kubectl scale deployment web --replicas=5`. Which RBAC verb does this actually require on the subject?**

- A) `update` on `deployments`
- B) `patch` on `deployments` (or `update`/`patch` on `deployments/scale`)
- C) `create` on `deployments`
- D) `list` on `deployments`

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B** — `kubectl scale` performs a partial modification, which maps to the `patch` verb (or a `patch`/`update` grant on the `scale` subresource specifically) — not a full-object `update`, and not `create` or `list`, which are unrelated to changing an existing object's replica count.
Trap: A picks the plausible-sounding but wrong verb — `update` implies a full-object PUT replace, which `kubectl scale` doesn't perform.
